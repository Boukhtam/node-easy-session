[easy-session](https://github.com/DeadAlready/node-easy-session) is a session extension and middleware for express and
connect with the aim of providing few convenience functions and security features.

# Installation

    $ npm install easy-session

# Usage

To use easy-session simply require the module and run the .main function with express or connect.
This will return the middleware to bind to the stack. It can easily be done with two lines:

	var express = require('express');
	var easySession = require('easy-session'); // Require the module : line 1

	var app = express();

	app.use(express.cookieParser());
	app.use(express.session({secret: 'keyboard cat'});
	app.use(easySession.main(express)); // Bind the module : line 2


# Options

The middleware supports the following configuration object that can be sent as a second argument to the easySession.main
function

	{
		ipCheck: {boolean} // Defines if IP must be consistent during the session - defaults to true
		uaCheck: {boolean} // Defines if UA must be consistent during the session - defaults to true
		freshTimeout: {time in ms} // Time since last request still under the maxFreshTimeout
						// when the session is considered fresh - defaults to 5 minutes
		maxFreshTimeout: {time in ms} // Time after which the session is considered stale
						// no matter the activity
	}

The IP and UA (User Agent) checks are a method against session hijacking - if the IP or User Agent changes mid-session then
it is a good chance that the session has been hijacked. In which case it should be invalidated.

# Functions

easy-session adds the following extra functions to the Session object.

## login([extend], cb)

Function for logging the user in.
Regenerates the session and adds _loggedInAt to the session object.
Depending on the configuration also adds _ip and _ua for continuity checks.
If an extend object is added then the key:value pairs are added to the session.

	req.session.login(function (err) {
		if(!err) {
			// Here we have a logged in session
		}
	});

	req.session.login({userId: 10}, function (err) {
	  if(!err) {
	    // Here we have a logged in session
	    console.log(req.session.userId); // Will print 10;
	  }
	});


## logout(cb)

Function for logging out the user.
Is just a proxy for session regeneration.

	req.session.logout(function (err) {
	  if(!err) {
	    // Here we have a logged out session
	  }
	});

## isGuest()

Function for checking if the user is a guest.
Returns true if logged out, false if logged in.

	if(!req.session.isGuest()) {
		// Logged in user
	}

## isLoggedIn()

Function for checking if the user is logged in.
Will return the opposite of isGuest();

	if(req.session.isLoggedIn()) {
		// Logged in user
	}

## isFresh()

Function for checking if the logged in session is fresh or stale.
Returns true if fresh, false if stale.

	if(req.session.isFresh()) {
		// User has logged in recently - session is fresh
	}

# isLoggedInMiddleware

Easy-session also provides an isLoggedInMiddleware to check if the user is logged in and handle it accordingly.
Usage:

	app.get('/restricted', easySession.isLoggedIn(), function (req, res, next) {
		// If the user reaches this then they are logged in.
		// Otherwise they get 401
	});

You can also set it before all validation routes

	app.all('*', easySession.isLoggedIn());

	app.get('/restricted', function (req, res, next) {
		// If the user reaches this then they are logged in.
    // Otherwise they get 401
	});

You can pass a custom error handler as well

	app.all('*', easySession.isLoggedIn(function (req, res, next) {
		// A user that is logged out will reach this.
		// Can handle unauthorized here.
	}));
